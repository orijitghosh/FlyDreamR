\title{Create a Faceted Plot of HMM Inferred States}
\usage{
HMMFacetedPlot(HMMinferList, col_palette = "default")
}
\arguments{
\item{HMMinferList}{A list. The output of \code{HMMbehavr}. The second element
HMMinferList[\link{2}] is expected to be a data frame.}

\item{col_palette}{Name of desired color palette. Currently 2 options are
partially supported - \code{default}, and \code{AG}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2} object representing the faceted plot.
}
\description{
This function generates a single faceted ggplot object displaying
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) inferred behavioral states for multiple
individuals and days. Global X and Y axis titles are displayed for the
entire faceted plot. Axis tick labels are shown on the outer panels
as per ggplot2's default faceting behavior. Facet strip labels for 'day'
are prefixed with "Day: ".
}
\examples{
# Assuming res1 is the output from HMMbehavr
# faceted_plot <- HMMFacetedPlot(HMMinferList = res1, col_palette = "default")
# print(faceted_plot)
}
